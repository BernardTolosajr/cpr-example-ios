C++ Requests is a simple wrapper around [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl) inspired by the excellent [Python Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) project.

Despite its name, libcurl's easy interface is anything but, and making mistakes misusing it is a common source of error and frustration. Using the more expressive language facilities of C++11, this library captures the essence of making network calls into a few concise idioms.

## Documentation

You can find the latest documentation [here](https://whoshuu.github.io/cpr). It's a work in progress, but it should give you a better idea of how to use the library than the [tests](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr/tree/master/test) currently do.
